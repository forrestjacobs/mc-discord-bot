# mc-discord-bot

This Discord bot can start, stop, and inspect a Minecraft server running on the
same host. The bot expects the host to have one or more systemd services for the
Minecraft server with a name like `mc-world-*`.

This project is open source in the sense that anyone can see the code, but it is
tuned specifically to the author's needs. Please fork this project if you want
to develop it into a generally useful bot.
